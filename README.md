## story & inspiratins
My inspiration for creating a video game comes from my lifelong passion for gaming. Ever since I played Mario 64, I've been fascinated by games, and this interest has only grown with titles like Valorant, League of Legends, and Sekiro. Now that I'm a developer, I have the skills to write code and bring my ideas to life. Combining my love for gaming with my technical abilities, I'm excited to create a game that reflects my passion and creativity.

## What is The Maze
this is a maze game similar to wolfstein 3d coded using raycasting and c.
the player spawns inside a maze like map and try to survive inside.

## How to develop without a game engine
To develop the game, I chose to use the C language since I was already somewhat familiar with it (although I could have opted for C++). The key element for creating a game without relying on a game engine was the SDL library.

The SDL library proved essential for this project, as it enabled me to create a window, render various elements such as shapes, colors, and textures, and handle user inputs.

clone the repo and have fun!!

## What I could have done more
    The game is still incomplete.
    I did not add wepons yet.
    I did not add enemies yet.
    The map has no Exit to win the game so its roguelike now.
    The game needs to be optimised.
